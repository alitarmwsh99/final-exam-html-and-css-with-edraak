Using all what you’ve learned so far in HTML and CSS, please create a copy of this website

and make sure to adhere to the following notes:

All five icons are provided in a folder called icons, use them as you see fit, but make sure they’re all aligned and are the same size.

The left side of the website (login part) should be a form, including the button.

The form has a slightly different background than the rest of the website, pay attention to that.

The colour used for buttons is HEX:#3DB4B7 / RGB: 61,180,183 and should only be applied on the buttons, not the logos (those can remain black as provided).

Registration button should lead to www.edraak.org once clicked.
